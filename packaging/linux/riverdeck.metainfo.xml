	<description>
		<p>RiverDeck is an application for using stream controller devices like the Elgato Stream Deck.</p>
		<p>RiverDeck is forked from OpenDeck and supports the majority of the original Stream Deck plugins, unlike other third-party options which are often more limited.</p>
		<p>Please note that you may need to install udev subsystem rules for your device to be detected. For more information, see the Installation section of the project README on GitHub.</p>
		<p>Many plugins are not compiled for Linux, so you may need to have Wine (and Wine Mono) installed on your system (natively, as the Wine Flatpak is not supported).</p>
