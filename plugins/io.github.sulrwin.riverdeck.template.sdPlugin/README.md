# RiverDeck Plugin Template

This is a minimal template for creating **RiverDeck-native** plugins.

## What you need to do

- Update IDs/UUIDs in `assets/manifest.json`
- Implement your action logic in `src/main.rs`
- Build a Linux binary into `linux/bin/` (see `build.ts`)
- Use **Manage Plugins** in RiverDeck to install from the workspace `plugins/` directory
